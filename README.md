# Super Vocab

A **unofficial** spaced Repetition add-on to [Supernotes](supernotes.app).

## About the project
The idea of the project originated in early June 2023,
when I started using [Supernotes](supernotes.app), for
my daily notes. I started building my second brain
and learned to really love it. But the App has a flaw, not
a big one but in my opinion there is a feature that for 
students is unavoidable. Which is spacial repetition and 
please don't mistake me, as a student the app is awesome,
but I really love spaced repetition systems that integrate
into my note-taking, like remnote. So I decided to build something
like this on my own. And thanks to the awesome support by 
[Connor](https://github.com/acnebs) and [Tobias](https://github.com/tobeagram), 
I was able to quickly start developing on this project.
